multiple pages (instance tree per page?? probably not)

better event listener handling, write some custom helper for it

???:
post render method that modifies render dom before it is send using jsdom to make do


future:
gziping ws sending data as blob achivable with configuration of ws npm
fork dom-diff or write more efficient one that will produce smaller diffs
 reasoing: something wierd with dom diff, works but unnecesery updates



life cycle methods:
constuctor - called only if this component may need to change
    used only for props assigning

mount - called only once, property change is cached
    useful for network requests

init - called every time constuctor is called after constuctor
    useful for effects
    subscription to something

should component update?
on prop change?
pre render?
post render? (access to dom for post render dom changes?)

on finish? - before instance is removed
    useful for unsubscribing and clean up stuff

static render - called every time even if component didn't changed
